## Voting App with ReactJS + Firebase

Using ReactJS and Firebase to build this was pretty interesting in the sense that you can see real time updates on the page. For instance, open the app in two different tabs, side by side. Make changes in one of the tabs and watch the other automagically update.

To install all dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```
